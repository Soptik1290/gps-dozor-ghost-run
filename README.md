# 🏎️ GPS Dozor: Ghost Run

**AI-powered tactical racing engine for delivery fleets.** Transform mundane delivery routes into high-stakes precision runs using real-time telemetry, AI-driven feedback, and historical ghost matching. Works as a complete mission control system for both field pilots (drivers) and fleet command (admins).

> [!NOTE]
> This project was **VibeCoded in Antigravity** using autonomous agentic workflows.

## ✨ Features

*   **👻 AI-Powered Ghost Racing** – Match your current route against personal bests or top-tier teammates. Visualize the "Ghost" on a tactical Mapbox HUD in real-time.
*   **🎮 Tactical HUD** – Premium glassmorphic interface with real-time telemetry, efficiency gauges, and dynamic scanline overlays for a high-intensity "mission" feel.
*   **🎙️ Race Engineer Debrief** – Context-aware AI feedback powered by GPT-4o-mini. Get spoken tactical advice based on your speed, weather, and driving efficiency.
*   **📂 Mission Archive** – Comprehensive telemetry breakdown for every sortie. Analyze sector success rates, temporal deltas, and chassis integrity (eco-driving events).
*   **🛡️ Fleet Command** – Global oversight for admins. Track active assets, monitor fleet-wide efficiency matrices, and manage high-stakes challenges.
*   **🌤️ Dynamic Track Status** – Integrated weather data affecting "track conditions" (WET, ICY, STORM) with corresponding UI ambient theming.
*   **⚖️ Eco-Efficiency Scoring** – Gamified scoring system that rewards smoothness. Earn ranks (S, A, B, C, F) based on pacer matching and safety events.
